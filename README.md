# Is there a Rockies game today?

This is my little Rockies-specific fork of [isthereagiantstoday.com](http://isthereagiantsgametoday.com), which is itself a Github project based at https://github.com/lforrest/isthereagiantsgametoday . 

## Differences from isthereagiantsgametoday.com

* Rockies purple and gray!
* Added a script to help automate data population from a Google spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Asw39a0iCguZdC1YWnJwTlY1OE9yeFhWMHFWYTBIVkE&output=html
* [CSS typographic pedantry](http://css-tricks.com/sans-serif/)

## Contributing

This Github project is my first public repository! Please bear with me if I'm noobish in my management of a project open to the community.

If you encounter any problems, please advise me of them by opening an issue at https://github.com/zekeweeks/istherearockiesgametoday/issues . You are also invited to submit any Rockies-specific enhancements to this project via pull requests; if your contribution might benefit people using this for other teams as well, please consider contributing to [the upstream project](https://github.com/lforrest/isthereagiantsgametoday) instead.


## TODOs

* Prettier color scheme (CSS pull requests welcomed!)
* Fully automate game data population.
* Add the Rockies' games at the 2012 World Series :-)
